## Requirements

### Python

Please install python `>= 3.12` and [configure your python virtual environment](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/virtual-environments/#create-a-virtual-environment):

```python
# create the virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# activate the the virtual environment in the command line
source .venv/bin/activate

# update pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# run app
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8085 --reload

```

This opinionated template uses the [`Fast API`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) Python API framework.

This and all other runtime python libraries must reside in `requirements.txt`

Other non-runtime dependencies used for dev & test must reside in `requirements-dev.txt`

### Docker

This repository uses Docker throughput its lifecycle i.e. both for local development and the environments. A benefit of this is that environment variables & secrets are managed consistently throughout the lifecycle

See the `Dockerfile` and `compose.yml` for details

### Linting and Formatting

This project uses [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and formatting Python code.

#### Running Ruff

To run Ruff from the command line:

```bash
# Run linting with auto-fix
ruff check . --fix

# Run formatting
ruff format .
```

#### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run linting and formatting checks automatically before each commit.

The pre-commit configuration is defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

To set up pre-commit hooks:

```bash
# Set up the git hooks
pre-commit install

# Alternatively, use the provided setup script
python scripts/setup_hooks.py
```

To run the hooks manually on all files:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

#### VS Code Configuration

For the best development experience, configure VS Code to use Ruff:

1. Install the [Ruff extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff) for VS Code
2. Configure your VS Code settings (`.vscode/settings.json`):

```json
{
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.fixAll.ruff": "explicit",
        "source.organizeImports.ruff": "explicit"
    },
    "ruff.lint.run": "onSave",
    "[python]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "charliermarsh.ruff",
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
            "source.fixAll.ruff": "explicit",
            "source.organizeImports.ruff": "explicit"
        }
    }
}
```

This configuration will:

- Format your code with Ruff when you save a file
- Fix linting issues automatically when possible
- Organize imports according to isort rules

#### Ruff Configuration

Ruff is configured in the `.ruff.toml` file

## Local development

### Setup

Libraries: Ensure the python virtual environment is configured and libraries are installed using `requirements-dev.txt`, [as above](#python)

Environment variables: `compose/aws.env`

Secrets: `compose/secrets.env`. You need to create this, as it's excluded from version control.

### Development

The app can be run locally using Docker compose.  This template contains a local environment with:

- Localstack
- MongoDB
- This service

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
docker compose watch
```

Alternatively you can start it using:
```
 uvicorn app.main:app --log-config logging-dev.json --reload
```

### Testing

Ensure the python virtual environment is configured and libraries are installed using `requirements-dev.txt`, [as above](#python)

Testing follows the [FastApi documented approach](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/testing/); using pytest & starlette.

To test the application run:

```bash
pytest
```

### Production

To mimic the application running in `production mode locally run:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Stop the application with

```bash
docker compose down
```

Alternatively you can start it using:

```bash
$ uvicorn app.main:app --host=0.0.0.0 --log-config logging.json --no-access-log
```


## API endpoints

| Endpoint             | Description                    |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| `GET: /docs`         | Automatic API Swagger docs     |
| `GET: /example`      | Simple example                 |

## Custom Cloudwatch Metrics

Uses the [aws embedded metrics library](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-embedded-metrics-python). An example can be found in `metrics.py`

In order to make this library work in the environments, the environment variable `AWS_EMF_ENVIRONMENT=local` is set in the app config. This tells the library to use the local cloudwatch agent that has been configured in CDP, and uses the environment variables set up in CDP `AWS_EMF_AGENT_ENDPOINT`, `AWS_EMF_LOG_GROUP_NAME`, `AWS_EMF_LOG_STREAM_NAME`, `AWS_EMF_NAMESPACE`, `AWS_EMF_SERVICE_NAME`

## Pipelines

### Dependabot

We have added an example dependabot configuration file to the repository. You can enable it by renaming
the [.github/example.dependabot.yml](.github/example.dependabot.yml) to `.github/dependabot.yml`

### SonarCloud

Instructions for setting up SonarCloud can be found in [sonar-project.properties](./sonar-project.properties)
